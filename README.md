# Survey-PPT
The codes used to solve financial problems in my survey PPT task.

1. The RNN.py is used to do the text sentiment analysis based on Reccurent Neural Networks, to check if there is a significant relationship between star ratings and reviews body.
2. The K-Means.py is used to divide all of the reviews into K groups based on the K-Means algorithm.
3. The Length of reviews.py is used to get the length of every review's body.
4. The Probit Regression.py is used to do the data preprocessing of Probit regression, which would be run in the EViews later.
5. The Words Frequency Counting.py is used to count every word in all of the reviews, and sort them in the descending order.
